# Good Day

Dwayne Phillips

Problem solving leadership, computer and systems engineering, project management, writing

I have worked in and around the US Intelligence Community since 1980. At one time I wrote software. Then someone made me manage software projects and such. I wrote about my experiences (see books and publications list below).

I have a book I wrote on image processing and all the source code in one repository. I use the other repositories for knowledge management and various experiments.
